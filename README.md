# We Used: Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

- We modified the README only to show you we are the best team in the modding community (REALLY bad joke), and to make you look into every single thing in the mod, we even hid some secrets and we want you to also know us more, so we would really appreciate it if you visited [our webpage](https://www.natunatic.xyz) and our other projects we are going to make ;)
